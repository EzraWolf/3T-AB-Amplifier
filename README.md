# 3T-AB-Amplifier
3 transistor class AB audio amplifier with stage driver and bias.
schematics made in EasyEDA because I'm a noob. I'm learning eagle,
but with EasyEDA's partnership with JLCPCB and LCSC, its hard to beat.

I was able to recreate an AB audio amplifier with ease. I've made a PCB for it and I will update when they come!
SMT Assembly will also be fun :)
